Python Practice: 20 Mini Projects in 30 Days

Welcome to my 20 Mini Projects in 30 Days Challenge! 🎉 This repository documents my journey as I tackle small to medium complexity Python projects to improve my coding skills. Each project is saved as a standalone script within this repository. 

I started this challenge on December 14, 2024, and my goal is to complete all 20 projects by January 13, 2025. Feel free to explore, use, or adapt these projects for your own learning! 🚀
